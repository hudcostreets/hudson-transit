As of October 2023:
- weekday ridership was 62% of 2019
- weekend ridership was 90% of 2019

Service remains down in both cases, so it's not apples to apples.

## Methods <a id="methods"></a>

### PATH Monthly Data <a id="path-data"></a>

#### 1. Download "PATH Ridership Reports (By Month)" <a id="download-data"></a>

- outputs in [`data/*.pqt`](data/)

```bash
y=2024
m=3
papermill -p year $y -p last_month $m -p template 2023-PATH-Monthly-Ridership-Report.tabula-template.json monthly.ipynb out/monthly-$y.ipynb
```
